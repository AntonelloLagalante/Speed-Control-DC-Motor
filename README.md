# Speed Control of a SE-DC Motor

Project held at the Politecnico di Milano in the exam "Dynamics of Electrical Machines and Drives" held by prof. Dezza. 
  
A DC-SE motor is used to move an ATM trailway "Carelli 1928". Objectives of the project are:
- determine the motor parameters for a white-box system identification.
- design and simulate a speed control in order to cover a 10 km track composed of varying slope and speed.

Description of the files contained in the archive:
- DC_SE_motor_control: parameters identification and PI controllers tuning.
- DC_SE_motor_control_sim: simulation of the closed-loop control system (simulink).
- Report: specifications, calculations, and discussion of results.
