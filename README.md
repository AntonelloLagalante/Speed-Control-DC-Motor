# Speed Control of a SE-DC Motor for Traction

<pre>
  Project held at the Politecnico di Milano in the exam "Dynamics of Electrical Machines and Drives" held by prof. Dezza. 
  
A DC-SE motor is used in the project to move an ATM trailway "Carelli 1928". Objectives of the project are to determine  the motor parameters for model development and to design and simulate a speed control in order to cover a 10 km track composed of varying slope and speed.

  Description of the files contained in the archive:
  - DC_SE_motor_control: computation of data for the model and declaration of PI controllers
  - DC_SE_motor_control_sim: control model simulated in simulink
  - Report: specifications, calculations, and discussion of results
