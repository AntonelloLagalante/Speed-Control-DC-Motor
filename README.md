# Speed Control of a SE-DC Motor for Traction

Project held at the Politecnico di Milano in the exam "Dynamics of Electrical Machines and Drives" held by prof. Dezza. 
A DC-SE motor is used in the project to move an ATM trailway "Carelli 1928". Objectives of the project are to determine  the motor parameters for model development and to design and simulate a speed control in order to cover a 10 km track composed of varying slope and speed.
